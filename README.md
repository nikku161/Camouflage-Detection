# Camouflage Object Detection Project

This project employs Deep Learning techniques to identify and segment camouflaged objects in images. Utilizing the PyTorch library, the U-Net model is constructed to predict the location and segmentation of both naturally and artificially camouflaged objects.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises of 2250 images with a focus on two categories: naturally camouflaged objects and artificially camouflaged objects. These typically correspond to animals and humans in the real world, respectively. The dataset is further divided into 1000 images for training and 250 for testing.

## Model
The U-Net architecture, widely used for image segmentation tasks, forms the backbone of the model. It consists of an encoder (downsampler) and decoder (upsampler) network. The model uses the Adam optimizer with a learning rate scheduler for efficient optimization.

## Training
The model undergoes training over numerous epochs, with state saving for every epoch. This ensures that the model can be restored to any previous state if required, making it ready for deployment in real-world scenarios.

## Results
With the implemented architecture and techniques, the model achieved an approximate accuracy of 89% in identifying and segmenting camouflaged objects in the test set.
